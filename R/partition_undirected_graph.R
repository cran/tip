#' @title Partition an undirected graph
#' @description A function that iteratively applies the transformation max(0, .graph_matrix - cutoff) until
#' there are <.num_components> graph components where cutoff = cutoff + .step_size. This is used to generate the one-cluster graph and plot.
#' @param .graph_matrix Matrix: a symmetric matrix that the analyst wishes to decompose into <.num_components> components.
#' @param .num_components Positive integer: the number of components that the analyst wishes to decompose <.graph_matrix> into.
#' @param .step_size Positive numeric: the size of the update for the cutoff in the transformation max(0, .graph_matrix - cutoff)
#' where cutoff = cutoff + .step_size.
#' @returns List with three elements:
#' \item{graph_component_members}{Vector. A vector of positive integers: the (i)th element is the graph component assignment for the (i)th subject.}
#' \item{cutoff}{Numeric. The value max(0, g_{i,j} - cutoff) so that there are <\code{.num_components}> components in the graph.}
#' \item{partitioned_graph_matrix}{Matrix. The graph with <\code{.num_components}> components (parts).}
