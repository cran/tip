#' @title Estimate the number of similar subjects
#' @description Estimate the number of similar subjects using univariate multiple change point detection (i.e., binary segmentation in the changepoint package).
#' @param .distance_matrix Matrix: a symmetric n x n matrix of distance values.
#' @returns Vector of positive integers: a vector of positive integers where the (i)th integer corresponds to the number of subjects (observations) that are similar to the (i)th subject.
